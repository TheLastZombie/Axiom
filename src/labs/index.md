## A place to store the pieces.

Labs is where, as I like to say, "everything else is". This is the place where I host services I want to try out, publish one-off experiments with JavaScript I write when I'm bored and more.

Keep in mind that all of these services should be seen as experiments, and may vanish at any point in time (i. e. whenever I decide I no longer want to maintain them).

Finally, note that most of these experiments will require JavaScript (in contradistinction to the rest of this site).

See the list at the right (or bottom, depending on your device), for a bit of documentation on everything that's being ran here.

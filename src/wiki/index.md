## Everything you never knew you wanted to know.

Welcome to the fourth iteration of my wiki! This page serves as documentation about the wiki itself as well as orientation as, well, landing page.

### Background

After [my hosting provider had a complete blackout](https://twitter.com/njal_la/status/1232572941516386304) – and because I had backups of the old wiki pages, but only as HTML – I decided to start from zero again entirely.

In January of 2021, I moved the backend from [Wiki.js](https://wiki.js.org/) to [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), due to the latter being much more leightweight, and as such, easier on the server – remember that everything you see is being served by a Raspberry Pi.

In Feburary of 2021, I moved the backend once more, this time to my own static site generator, [Axiom](https://github.com/TheLastZombie/Axiom), which now also powers my main website and blog.

### Contents

Similarly to the [wiki](https://wf203.net) I hosted for [WF203](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdyXT4tTNlgybFpEDYpcgCQ), this site isn't dedicated to one specific topic, but pretty much everything that interests (or, at some point, interested) me; primarily those with very little or no documentation elsewhere.

This includes, but is not limited to, [collecting](https://www.discogs.com/user/roesch/collection) and [digitizing](https://archive.org/details/@roesch?tab=uploads) obscure CDs and other media, running third-party programs on Nintendo consoles, commonly known as [Homebrew](https://gbatemp.net/members/rsch.453878/), and a lot of other topics which would go beyond the scope of this landing page.

### Archive

As mentioned above I made copies of all pages of the first, old iteration. These can be viewed here:

- [Home](home.htm)
- [Darken](darken.htm)
- [Piracy](piracy.htm)
- [Switch](switch.htm)

### Legacy

From 2014 to 2018, I made various tracks in whatever software I could get my hands on (this includes [WarioWare D.I.Y.](https://www.giantbomb.com/warioware-diy/3030-23985/) â€“ yes, really). Some are monotonous, some are weird, and some are actually still pretty good in my opinion.

I originally uploaded them to SoundCloud as singles, but as I stopped using that platform a long time ago, I since republished all tracks on Bandcamp as a compilation, sorted by the original release dates.

### The Albatross (working title)

I also have a new thing planned, but that thing is still in an early work-in-progress stage. Some lyrics are there, but I know next to nothing about music theory, so it'll probably take a while until I get it out.

It'll likely be very personal too, so I won't rush it.

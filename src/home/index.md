## Your acknowledgement of the truth has come at a great cost.

This website is my attempt at a less experimental, more grounded presence on the internet.

You can navigate between this site, my blog and my wiki via the menu on the left (or top), and between different pages on these sites via the links to the right (or bottom).

If you want, you can also [read more about me](about.html) or [view my previously implied, more experimental website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126054453/https://rxyz.rocks/).

All pages here and on all subdomains have been generated by the latest version of [Axiom](https://github.com/TheLastZombie/Axiom), a static site generator (including theme) I originally hacked together in a few days specifically for this site.

This site is intentionally kept simple â€“ no JavaScript, no CDNs, no cookies, no advertisements, no tracking. Just how I'd want a perfect website to be.

There used to be a mirror of this website, making it available via the [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) protocol, however I decided to remove it again, mainly because of two reasons:

- It was hard to maintain. I understand HTTP. I don't yet fully understand Gemini.
- The content doesn't fit. Everything on this site was written for the surface internet, and Gemini has quite a different energy.

That being said, the generation of GMI files wasn't removed from Axiom, and should you decide to use it yourself, setting up a Gemini mirror of your own presence should be relatively easy.
